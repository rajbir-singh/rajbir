#Optionally, you may choose ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource, which
#works much like ResourceBundleMessageSource, but it has the ability to reload message
#properties without recompiling or restarting the application. Here’s a sample
#configuration for ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource:
#@Bean
#public MessageSource messageSource() {
#ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource messageSource =
#new ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource();
#messageSource.setBasename("file:///etc/spittr/messages");
#messageSource.setCacheSeconds(10);
#return messageSource;
#}

#The key difference here is that the basename property is configured to look outside of
#the application (not in the classpath, like ResourceBundleMessageSource). The
#basename property can be set to look for messages in the classpath (with a classpath:
#prefix), in the filesystem (with a file: prefix), or at the root of the web application
#(with no prefix). Here, it’s configured to look for messages in properties files in the /
#etc/spittr directory of the server’s filesystem and with a base filename of “messages”.
